###### imgur links are all https

At first, people were complaining that imgur *wasn't* loaded via https.  Then people are complaining that imgur *is* loading via https.  Oye.

To meet in the middle, [in the next release of RES](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/commit/80a61def37bcb2415c0c95367665eb76f0def207), imgur links will be https only on https://reddit.com/


###### Colored circles on posts / colored comment scores disappeared!

It was a bug that those colors appeared in the first place.  That has been remedied.

You can enable these again:

Settings > UI > Vote Enhancements (voteEnhancements) [colorLinkScore](http://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/knownissues/4_5_1#!settings/voteEnhancements/colorLinkScore) and [colorCommentScore](http://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/knownissues/4_5_1#!settings/voteEnhancements/colorCommentScore)

###### Subreddit shortcut edit dropdown

You can disable it:

Settings > UI > Subreddit Manager (subredditManager) [dropdownEditButton](http://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/edit/knownissues/4_5_1#!settings/subredditManager/dropdownEditButton)
 Show "edit" and "delete" buttons in dropdown menu on subreddit shortcut bar

Or you can wait for the next release, which [adds a delay before showing the dropdown](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/commit/f579743201e26fa97c2bc4e078e716b8bebed40d).

###### Inline Image convertGifsToGfycat - images don't convert

Reported broken: http://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/2gdkbv/bug_res_is_changing_all_imgur_gifs_into_jpg/

[Fixed for next release](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1607)

###### Never-Ending Reddit not loading page 2

Never-Ending Reddit won't load any pages if you have an orangered (either on pageload or when loading page 2), betteReddit is off, but betteReddit - showUnreadCountInFavicon is on.

To resolve this, **turn off
[showUnreadCountInFavicon](/r/RESissues/wiki/knownissues/4_5_1#!settings/betteReddit/showUnreadCountInFavicon)** specifically.  ([Fixed for next release](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1608))

Chrome 38 (beta) may also break on some security restriction.  This is probably a beta issue and should be resolved by the Chrome team.  [tracked on res github](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1618)

###### hardIgnore not hiding posts on post listings

If you have ignored a user (via user tagger) and turned on [hardIgnore](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/knownissues/4_5_1#!settings/userTagger/hardIgnore), then posts from an ignored user will not be hidden.  Furthermore, user tags will not show for any subsequent users.

[Fixed for next release](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1622)

Workaround: turn off hardIgnore for now.

###### Account switcher doesn't work in Chrome Incognito

[Fixed for next release](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/pull/1620#issuecomment-55650823)


###### Subreddit shortcut dropdown edit button only works for first shortcut hovered-over

[More discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/2gmd9r/bug_subreddit_shortcut_edit_button_only_works_for/)

[Fixed for next release](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/commit/b56b6385e88f0116bd8a38d192d63324a9da8a86)

###### HTTPS changes

###### Mixed content warnings

[Not a bug](http://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/2fv0ib/bug_mixed_content_warning_with_res_new_ssl/ckd5gqr), but [we're working on it](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/compare/32c605b9a8cda52671f797ae213305b2abbb3ef5...07d49a858044d67bf8f706710ea8cf0ffd9be1f5) anyway.
