###### Album expandos don't show

Album expandos are no longer supported in RES v4.5.4 (or any previous versions) because Imgur [shut down the old API that version was using](http://api.imgur.com/2/) on March 30, 2016.

When RES v4.6.1 is available for Safari, everything will be fine.  In the meanwhile, sorry -- you can click through instead.
If you deliberately downgraded to RES v4.5.4, then you get to live with no expandos.
