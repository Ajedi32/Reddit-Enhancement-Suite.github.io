###### Account Switcher broken in Firefox 48+

Account Switcher doesn't do anything due to a breaking change in Firefox 48.

This is fixed in RES v4.7.4, which can be installed via the [beta channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESAnnouncements/comments/4vt35o/announcement_chrome_and_firefox_beta_releases/).

[More discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/4vxfow/bug/)

###### Can't resize certain image links

###### i.reddituploads.com

###### i.redd.it

Images from reddituploads.com and i.redd.it are not resizable and do not show when "view images" is turned on.

This is fixed in the next release of RES.

###### Media expando (inline images) changes

###### Images automatically shown, can't resize

reddit now automatically opens the linked image when visiting a comments page. These expandos can't be resized and don't use RES's keyboard navigation.

You can disable this with the [new preferences](http://i.imgur.com/706GVIR.png) available on your [preferences page](http://reddit.com/prefs).

###### NewCommentCount notification ("subscribe to thread") doesn't show

**[New Comment Count](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/newCommentCount)** notifications (pop-up for "new comment made on post") don't show.

No workaround at the moment. Instead, periodically check in on [/r/Dashboard "My Subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dashboard#newCommentsLinkListing) and click the [... "as reddit listing"](https://i.imgur.com/xlGXdxX.png) link near the top.
