###### User info shows NaN for suspended users

https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/2570

###### Comment karma commas

reddit recently added commas to link karma. To also add commas in comment karma, turn on: **[useCommas](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/showKarma/useCommas)**
-- [](#gear) RES Settings Console > Accounts  > Show Comment Karma

The next release will turn on commas (or locale-appropriate separator) by default.

###### Semicolon in private messages deletes the rest of the message

When using the "Quick Message" pop-up composer for private messages, any text following a semicolon (semi-colon, semi colon) isn't sent. This is fixed for the next release.  There is no workaround.

###### "next" button and Never-Ending Reddit "load next page" banner don't show on search page

Never-Ending Reddit doesn't work properly on reddit's new search layout. The "next" and "previous" buttons are hidden and the "load next page" banner doesn't show. This has been fixed for the next release of RES.

Select one option to fix this:

* Turn on **[show legacy search page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#legacy_search)** - [reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) > display options > [show legacy search page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#legacy_search).
* Turn off **[Never Ending Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/neverEndingReddit)**
-- [](#gear)
[RES settings console](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings) > Posts > [Never Ending Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/neverEndingReddit "neverEndingReddit")
* Add a CSS snippet to Stylish for reddit.com:

    `.res:not(.res-v4) .content .nav-buttons .nextprev,`
    `.res:not(.res-v4) .content div.nav-buttons {`
    `    display: block; `
    `} `

###### Vote arrows are still visible on archived posts

You cannot vote or comment on posts which are archived (older than 6 months) or locked (by subreddit moderators). RES can [hides the vote buttons](/#!settings/styleTweaks/hideUnvotable), but a recent change to reddit markup has broken RES detecting these posts.

This is fixed for the next version.

###### Expando images don't show on search page

RES v4.5.4 does not show image expandos on reddit's new search layout.  This has been fixed for the next release.

To work around this for now, turn on **[show legacy search page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#legacy_search)** - [reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) > display options > [show legacy search page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#legacy_search).

---

###### Keyboard navigation doesn't work on search page

RES v4.5.4 keyboard navigation doesn't work on reddit's new search layout.  This has been fixed for the next release.

To work around this for now, turn on **[show legacy search page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#legacy_search)** - [reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) > display options > [show legacy search page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#legacy_search).

###### NSFW button is black/hard to see in nightmode

This is an (unintended) side effect of reddit changing the NSFW indicator. [Fixed for the next release.](http://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/pull/2245)

---

###### Beta flask icon covers up beginning of username

Fixed for next release.

To work around this, turn off **[User Bar Hider](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/userbarHider)**
-- [](#gear)
[RES settings console](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings) > Accounts > [User Bar Hider](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/userbarHider "userbarHider")

###### Imgur gallery expandos show the wrong image

Fixed for next release.

---

###### GIFVs inside imgur albums show as GIFs

Not yet fixed, but /u/andytuba is gonna work real hard on fixing a lot of imgur issues for the next release.

---

###### Nightmode - blindingly white blocks, dark text on dark background

Fixed for next release.

reddit [changed the sitewide user-text stylesheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/2tw6pm/reddit_change_changes_to_default_text_styling/) in January 2015. Night mode has been updated to match.

You can work around this for now by adding custom CSS using Stylish: https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/3fbj4p/thought_id_share_my_style_fixes_for_res_night/

If you have [reddit gold](/gold/about), you can select a dark [reddit theme](https://www.reddit.com/r/goldbenefits/comments/33ei8y/introducing_reddit_themes_change_the_appearance/) instead of RES' night mode.

---

###### Vote weights (username [+1]) don't change on upvote/downvote

[Fixed for next release.](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1926)

You can manually change the vote weight number by clicking on a user's number or user tag, then changing the "Vote Weight" field and saving the new user tag.

If you're feeling brave and using Firefox, you can patch it yourself. [More discussion (slightly outdated)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/2qsssj/bug_vote_weights_wont_change_when_i_upvotedownfote/cnchz3h?context=1) Even [more discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/3p7yky/bug_recent_reddit_change_on_voting_javascript/cw4cp5b)

1. [**Back up your settings.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/backing_up_res_settings)
1. **Close your browser.**
1. Find your browser's copy of RES.  It's [near where your RES settings are stored](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/backing_up_res_settings).
1. Find `userTagger.js` and open it in a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit.
1. Find line 431 of userTagger.js.  It should look like this:
     `var voteButtons = obj.querySelectorAll('.likes .arrow');`
     Change it to this:
    `var voteButtons = obj.querySelectorAll('.midcol .arrow');`
     Change line 457 from this:
     `if (e.target.getAttribute('onclick').indexOf('unvotable') === -1) {`
     to this:
     `if (!e.target.classList.contains('archived')) {`
     Change line 503 from this:
     `if (this.classList.contains('up')) {`
     to this:
     `if (this.classList.contains('upmod')) {`
     And change line 522 from this:
     `if (this.classList.contains('down')) {`
     to this:
     `if (this.classList.contains('downmod')) {`
1. Save the file.
1. Re-open your browser

**Chrome** users, **this workaround is no longer an option!** Chrome is treating the changes as "the extension may have been corrupted" and will disable it. If you have already edited the extension and Chrome has disabled RES, **[back up your data](/r/Enhancement/wiki/backing_up_res_settings)** and reinstall RES.

###### Never-Ending Reddit "load next page" banner pushed below sidebar, Never-Ending Reddit doesn't load until I scroll all the way down

Is fixed for next release.

Workaround: change your [reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) > link options > "show [25] links per page" to a higher number

---

###### Duplicate subreddits in "My Subreddits" dropdown

This is fixed for the next release.

**[clearSubreddits](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/troubleshooter/clearSubreddits)**
-- [](#gear)
[RES settings console](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings) > About RES > [Troubleshooter](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/troubleshooter "troubleshooter")  > [clearSubreddits](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/troubleshooter/clearSubreddits)

Reset the 'My Subreddits' dropdown contents in the event of old/duplicate/missing entries.

###### Image gallery resets to first image (image 1) on scroll

This issue persists from RES v4.5.0.2

[It is fixed for the next release.](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/pull/2012#issuecomment-72796349)

Workaround: turn off **[conserveMemory](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/showImages/conserveMemory)**
-- [](#gear)
[RES settings console](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings) > UI > [Inline Image Viewer](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/showImages "showImages")  > [conserveMemory](https://www.reddit.com/#!settings/showImages/conserveMemory).

###### Source shows &lt; instead of > (quote) and other &...; (ampersand) issues

Fixed for next release.

---

###### Some formatting (code, bullet points, etc..) do not work with Nightmode

Fixed for next release

---

###### Some posts have two duplicate expandos (gfycat, etc.)

Fixed for the next version.

This bug occurs when both reddit and RES add an expando to the same post. In the next version RES will just replace reddit expandos, so this shouldn't happen again. ~~Before that's released you can (usually) get rid of reddit's expando by [enabling https in your reddit preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/security/). This only works because embedly (reddit's embed provider) doesn't seem to support HTTPS, though, so it may not be permanent.~~ This doesn't work so well anymore, [more expandos support HTTPS](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/35fa8149d50b97ca1dddf4e510976d70c445f20a).
