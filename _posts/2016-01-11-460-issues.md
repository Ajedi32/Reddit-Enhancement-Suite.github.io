###### SelectedEntry autoSelectOnScroll selects thing at bottom of page
###### Page immediately scrolling down when loading link listings

Fixed for 4.6.1: https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/2623
The fix will stop scrolling the page to the selected post, plus an option to re-enable that; and options to select the last thing or the first thing or nothing at all.


WORKAROUND: Turn off Selected Entry. (This kills the keynav, though.).  --andytuba 11am pacific 2016-01-11

###### Night mode is colorful

The RES team will post an update next week on how to tweak nightmode, to determine the most important aspects to tweak and prepare instructions on how to easily get an update.

As of 9am 2016-01-11 Pacific, the post titles should be back to white. If you preferred them colorful: add a new row with **res-nightMode-coloredLinks** to **[bodyClasses](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESAnnouncements/comments/40fo85/announcement_at_long_last_res_v460_is_released/cyu6l80#!settings/stylesheet/bodyClasses)**

###### User karma is slow to load

As of 11am 2016-01-11 Pacific, we're seeing occasional slowness or failures to show link karma to the right of your username in the top right corner. It looks like the reddit servers are struggling a little, and hope it will resolve itself.
