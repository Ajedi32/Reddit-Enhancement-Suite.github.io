###### Black background on selected comment makes text impossible to read

There's a bug with setting the correct default color.  You can fix it by changing **[focusBGColorNight](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/2ppgwx/bug_night_mode_black_box_around_comment_or_title/#!settings/keyboardNav/focusBGColorNight)**

###### Never-Ending Reddit isn't loading the next page when I scroll to the bottom

Make sure Never-Ending Reddit isn't paused:

1. If you're at the top of the page, scroll down a few inches to make the button appear.
1. Look for the (>) or (||) button in the top right corner of the window.  It's next to the floating envelope button.
1. (If you have set [betteReddit - pinHeader](/r/RESissues/wiki/knownissues/4_5_2#!settings/betteReddit/pinHeader) to "Full Header", the play/pause button will be obscured by the header. Workaround: set [pinHeader](/r/RESissues/wiki/knownissues/4_5_2#!settings/betteReddit/pinHeader) to "None", save your settings, reload the page, unpause, then put your settings back.)
1. Click the button to unpause NER.

###### Account switcher logs me out, but doesn't log me in

Workaround: switch accounts twice.

This affects Firefox and Chrome.

This is fixed for the next release.


###### Inline image expandos

###### gifv download button only reloads the page

This is fixed for the next release.

###### Wrong aspect ratios in image galleries

This issue persists from [RES v4.5.0.2](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/knownissues/4_5_0_2#wiki_wrong_aspect_ratio_in_image_galleries).  However, /u/honestbleeps can [reproduce the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/2ck0dj/bug_res_is_not_keeping_images_aspect_ratio/cl9kn1u?context=3) and will probably fix it for the next release.


###### gifv  show on top of text

If you open a gifv expando, close it before it loads, and open it again, then the expando image may show on top of the text below it. **Workaround:** click and drag the image a little.

###### gifv is stuck/paused right after opening

If you open a gifv expando, close it before it loads, and open it again, then the expando image may get paused.  There is no workaround except reloading the page, just don't do this.
