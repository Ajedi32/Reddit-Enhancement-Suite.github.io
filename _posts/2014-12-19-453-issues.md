## All posts are being filtered

**[Fixed for next release](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/pull/1891)**


The filteReddit keywords filter's `unlessKeyword` is filtering all posts unless they match that keyword.  This affects anyone who set a keyword filter with an unlessKeyword and (unexpectedly) anyone who added a keyword filter before RES v4.5.1 and also filtered a subreddit.

To work around this, use the [unlessKeyword undefined batch cleaner](http://codepen.io/andytuba/full/ZYOxzB/) (great for lots of old filters) or follow these instructions:

1. Go to RES settings for **[keywords](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/edit/knownissues#!settings/filteReddit/keywords)**
-- [](#gear)
[RES settings console](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/edit/knownissues#!settings) > Filters > [filteReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/edit/knownissues#!settings/filteReddit "filteReddit")  > [keywords](https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/wiki/edit/knownissues#!settings/filteReddit/keywords)
1. Delete everything in the `unlessKeyword` column.
1. Save your options and reload /r/all.

Poor man's workaround: turn off the hovers.

## Hitting Enter submits the post/comment

[fixed for next release](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/issues/1885)

RES now submits a post or comment when you press  Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter. However, sometimes RES doesn't notice when you release the Ctrl/Cmd keys.

You can work around this by turning off the functionality.
